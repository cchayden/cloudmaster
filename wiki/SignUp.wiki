= AWS Sign Up =

You need to sign up with Amazon to use their web services.  You can do this by going to http://aws.amazon.com.  Note that their web services is separate from any account you might have to purchase merchandise.  You need to separately sign up for Elastic Compute Cloud, Simple Queue Service, and Simple Storage Service.  Charges are modest: the first release of !CloudMaster was developed for less than $3.00.

Once you complete the sign up you should browse to "AWS Access Identifiers".  This page contains credentials that you need to use the services.  There are two kinds of credentials:  keys (_access_key_ and _secret_key_) and a _certificate_.  You should generate the keys and use copy/paste to put them in a file on your computer.  Than you should create and download a certificate.  I suggest you store it in a directory {{{$HOME//keys}}}.
