#summary Set up your environment

= Environment Set Up =

A single environment varialbe {{{AWS_HOME}}} is used to specify where {{{cloudmaster}}} is installed.  All other configuration (such as your access key and secret key) are stored in {{{config.ini}}} in this directory.  To use the examples in this project, you also need to set up {{{PATH}}} and {{{RUBYLIB}}}

Here is what I have in by own .bash_profile.

{{{
export AWS_HOME=$HOME/cloudmaster
PATH=$PATH:$AWS_HOME/tools
export RUBYLIB=$AWS_HOME/lib
}}}

{{{AWS_HOME}}} is set to where you have stored the cloudmaster project.  It is used to set up your PATH and to build images.

!CloudMaster comes with a collection of useful tools (UsingTools).  Setting {{{PATH}}} and {{{RUBYLIB}}} as suggested allows you to use these tools.

Next we will set up AWS [AwsSetup].
